            Hello, my name is Ian Gerrebrands I'm 23 years old.
            I study Application Development at the Roc Mondriaan in the Hague.
            I did start programming 3 and a half year ago.
            I'm now a really motivated programmer and I like to code in my spare time.
            I learned a lot in the last 3 years, I did start with HTML5, javascript and CSS. I kept on learning and now I know Java, C#, Python, PHP and NodeJS.
            I have two certificates Java Fundementals and Database Design
          </p>

            The thing I love most about programming is to solve complex problems.
            I do also love to create the communication between client side and server side.
            What is good code in my opinion? Good code is code that everyone with a little bit of programming knowledge understands.
            Use comments in your code to explain complex things and do not write functions with 100 lines of code.
            I want to structure my code so its readable for everyone.
